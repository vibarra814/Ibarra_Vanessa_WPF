// to figure out the circumfrence you need to multiply 2 by pie by the radius

var total = circumfrence(3.14, 8);// gave values to pie and radius

function circumfrence(p, r){// made function to equate circumfrence
     var result = 2 * p * r; // actual equation
     return result;//function is spitting this info out
 }

 console.log("the circumfrence of the circle is " + total + " inches.")
